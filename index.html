           <h1>Smart Waste Management System</h1>
           <p>Smart Waste Management is a system that uses sensors to monitor the waste levels in bins and alerts the waste management company when the bins are full. This system helps to reduce the number of overflowing bins and ensures that the waste is collected in a timely manner.</p>

        <p>
            This Smart Waste Management System was inspired by the growing problem of inefficient waste collection in urban areas. 
            Living in a city where waste bins are often overflowing or empty yet still collected, I realized there was a need for a smarter, 
            more efficient approach to waste management. Using IoT technology, we aim to optimize collection schedules and reduce the city's 
            carbon footprint.

            The project development timeline spanned over the course of 3 months, during which our team of developers and engineers collaborated to 
            create a scalable solution. This project is part of the Holberton School Portfolio Project, where we applied our skills in full-stack development, 
            systems design, and project management.
